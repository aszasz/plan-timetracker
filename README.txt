plan-timetracker â€“ ptt
======================

An utility to summarize time tracking annotations in my (J. Carmack inspired) plan files.

The basic usage is: ptt <file> [<file> ...]

This works particularly well when combined with shell globbing and basic unix tools...

Basic use case:
$ ptt ~/plan/2017

Only process md/txt files (usefull to get rid of garbage such as Vim .swp files):
$ ptt ~/plan/2017/**/*.{md,txt} 2>/dev/null

Discard the per day (file) output and other auxiliary information:
$ ptt ~/plan/2017/**/*.{md,txt} 2>/dev/null

Pipe to grep to check for warnings:
$ ptt ~/plan/2017/**/*.{md,txt} 2>&1 | grep

Or to less to analyze the warnings:
$ ptt ~/plan/2017/**/*.{md,txt} 2>&1 | less
